# LessBuilder

**LessBuilder** is an extension for compilation of _Less_ files to the _CSS_ format, and the files can be tradicional or minimized using _NodeJS_ components.

In order for the extension to work correctly, it is necessary to have NodeJS installed, since two components will be used, being _less_ and _less-plugin-clean-css_.
